## Garden Boxes!!!!

Write a program that will take in a users garden box size, then let them pick from a list of plants and tell them how many they can plant in that space.

Please create a database that will hold plants. You don't need to add more than 2 or 3 plants into the database for testing.


## To run

Clone this repo then type `ruby program.rb`
